# Finploy Sitemap Generator

A comprehensive sitemap generator specifically designed for Finploy's dynamic job portal with 500+ URLs including job listings across locations, departments, products, sub-departments, companies, and designations.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project addresses the challenge of generating a complete sitemap for Finploy's complex website structure that includes:
- Static pages (about, contact, services)
- Dynamic job listings (jobs-in-location, department-jobs-in-location)
- Company profiles and department pages
- Nested content behind "View More" links
- Pagination and filtered results

## 🛠️ Technical Approach

### Multi-Strategy Crawling
1. **Requests-based crawling** for fast static content
2. **Selenium WebDriver** for JavaScript-heavy pages and dynamic content
3. **Async crawling** for improved performance
4. **Pattern-based URL generation** for comprehensive coverage

### Key Features
- **Smart URL Discovery**: Uses pattern matching to find job-related URLs
- **Dynamic Content Handling**: Clicks "View More" buttons and handles pagination
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents overwhelming the server
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Ensures no duplicate URLs in the sitemap
- **Validation**: Includes URL validation and accessibility checking
- **Metadata Extraction**: Captures page titles and descriptions

## 🚀 Installation & Usage

### Prerequisites
\`\`\`bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 selenium lxml aiohttp
\`\`\`

### Chrome WebDriver Setup
Download ChromeDriver from https://chromedriver.chromium.org/ and ensure it's in your PATH.

### Running the Generator

#### Basic Sitemap Generation 
\`\`\`bash
python scripts/sitemap_generator.py
\`\`\`

#### Advanced Async Crawling
\`\`\`bash
python scripts/advanced_crawler.py
\`\`\`

#### Sitemap Validation
\`\`\`bash
python scripts/sitemap_validator.py
\`\`\`

## 🔧 Configuration Options

### Customizable Parameters
- `max_urls`: Maximum number of URLs to crawl (default: 2000-3000)
- `max_concurrent`: Concurrent requests for async crawling (default: 10-15)
- `base_url`: Target website URL
- `crawl_delay`: Delay between requests (default: 0.5 seconds)

### URL Pattern Matching
The generator includes patterns for:
- Location-based jobs: `/jobs-in-{location}`
- Department jobs: `/{department}-jobs-in-{location}`
- Company pages: `/company/{company-name}`
- Job categories: `/jobs/{category}`

## 📊 Output Files

### sitemap.xml
Standard XML sitemap following sitemaps.org protocol with:
- URL locations
- Last modification dates
- Change frequencies (daily for jobs, weekly for static pages)
- Priority scores (1.0 for homepage, 0.8-0.9 for jobs, 0.6-0.7 for others)

### Enhanced Features
- **Categorized URLs**: Jobs, companies, locations, categories
- **Metadata Extraction**: Page titles and descriptions
- **Validation Reports**: URL accessibility and status codes
- **Duplicate Detection**: Ensures unique URLs only

## 🎯 Challenges Addressed

### 1. Dynamic Content Discovery
- **Challenge**: Job URLs generated via PHP filters not directly visible
- **Solution**: Pattern-based URL generation + comprehensive crawling

### 2. Nested Content Access
- **Challenge**: Content behind "View More" links
- **Solution**: Selenium automation to click expandable elements

### 3. Scale Limitations
- **Challenge**: 500+ URLs exceed free crawler limits
- **Solution**: Custom crawler with rate limiting and async processing

### 4. Performance Optimization
- **Challenge**: Crawling thousands of URLs efficiently
- **Solution**: Async crawling with concurrent request handling

## 📈 Results & Coverage

### Expected Output
- **Total URLs**: 1500-3000+ discovered URLs
- **Job Listings**: Comprehensive coverage of location-based jobs
- **Dynamic Content**: Successfully captures filtered and paginated results
- **Validation**: All URLs tested for accessibility

### URL Categories Covered
- Homepage and main sections
- Job listings by location (80+ Indian cities)
- Department-specific jobs (25+ departments)
- Company profiles and pages
- Static pages (about, contact, services)
- Blog and resource pages

## 🔍 Quality Assurance

### Validation Features
- HTTP status code checking
- Redirect detection
- Broken link identification
- Response time monitoring
- Duplicate URL prevention

### Sitemap Standards Compliance
- XML format following sitemaps.org protocol
- Proper encoding (UTF-8)
- Valid XML structure
- Appropriate priority and frequency settings

## 🚀 Deployment & Integration

### Usage Recommendations
1. Run the generator weekly to capture new job listings
2. Validate the sitemap before submission to search engines
3. Submit to Google Search Console and Bing Webmaster Tools
4. Monitor crawl statistics and update patterns as needed

### Automation Potential
- Schedule via cron jobs for regular updates
- Integrate with CI/CD pipelines
- Set up monitoring for sitemap freshness
- Automated submission to search engines

## 🛡️ Error Handling & Robustness

### Built-in Safeguards
- Request timeout handling
- Rate limiting to prevent server overload
- Retry logic for failed requests
- Graceful handling of JavaScript-disabled scenarios
- Memory-efficient processing for large URL sets

### Logging & Monitoring
- Comprehensive logging of crawl progress
- Error tracking and reporting
- Performance metrics collection
- URL discovery statistics
