Challenge 1: Scale Limitations
Problem: Standard generators limited to 500 URLs (free versions)
Solution: Custom Python crawler with no URL limits

Challenge 2: Dynamic Content Discovery  
Problem: PHP-generated URLs not directly visible
Solution: Pattern-based generation + selective crawling

Challenge 3: Nested Content Access
Problem: Content behind "View More" links
Solution: Smart URL pattern recognition and generation

Challenge 4: Performance Optimization
Problem: Need to process 800+ URLs efficiently
Solution: Multi-threading with 10-15 concurrent workers

Challenge 5: Server Overload Prevention
Problem: Avoid overwhelming target server
Solution: Rate limiting and smart request batching

Execution Time: 3-5 minutes total
URL Generation Rate: 200-300 URLs per minute
Total URLs Discovered: 800-1000+ URLs
Success Rate: 95%+ URL pattern accuracy
Memory Usage: Optimized for large-scale processing
Concurrent Workers: 10-15 threads
Request Timeout: 3-5 seconds per URL
Coverage: 20 departments × 60+ cities = 1200+ combinations


Primary Deliverables:
1. comprehensive_sitemap.xml (800+ URLs for finploy.com)
2. comprehensive_sitemap_uk.xml (UK version)
3. validation_report_main.json (URL accessibility results)
4. validation_report_uk.json (UK validation results)

XML Structure Example:
<?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-8'?>
<urlset xmlns="http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9">
